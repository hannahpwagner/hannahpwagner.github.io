	<H3>Early Life</H3>
	</div>
	<p>Hannah Wagner was born in a small town in Alabama on February 29th, 2000. She was born to Brad and Tanya and lived with their dog, Chloe. Although Chloe didn't like Hannah, Hannah felt very close to dogs as a baby and preferred to play with a hedgehog dog-toy as opposed to regular baby toys. When Hannah turned 1, her parents moved to Georgia which was a huge step up from Alabama.</p>

	<H3>Not-As Early Life</H3>
	</div>
	<p>Once they moved to Georgia, Hannah got a little sister named Zoe and her parents discovered Facebook. Both were horrible things because 1)her sister was an annoying baby and 2)her parents loved to post embarrassing photos. However, to cope, Hannah decided to participate in activities like swimming and theater, and she did pretty well in school too.</p>

	</div>
	<p>Because Hannah was such an overachiever at school (very annoying), she was able to attend the University of Georgia. Now, her parents only get minimal embarrassing content to post of her and she has limited contact with her sister. All is well in the world and now Hannah loves to spend her time sleeping and writing in html :)</P>
	<div style="text-align:center">
	<H3>Fun Facts</H3>
	</div>
	<p>Some things that Hannah is passionate about are french fries, coca-cola, clean sheets, a full tank of gas, large and small dogs, and Zyrtec because she has severe allergies.</p>
